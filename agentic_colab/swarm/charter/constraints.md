TIMELINE (US Eastern; hacking ends Sun Nov 1, 1:00 PM)
- Sat, as soon as compute and the referee are ready: swarm starts. Build and validate measuring tools first; nothing counts until a tool passes the planted cases.
- Sun 8:00 AM EST (2026-11-01T08:00:00-05:00; daylight saving ends at 2 AM that morning): freeze, enforced as SWARM_END. Agents stop for good, the board rejects agent writes, the referee shuts down. Deliverables must be final before then. The referee then runs the sealed tests.

EVIDENCE RULES
- A finding is a number with an uncertainty, from a method that passed the planted cases. Use the format in the playbook.
- Only findings replicated by another agent (independent code or seeds) go in the final report.
- Every claimed improvement needs a control that would catch a fake win.
- Anything found on simulated or computer-rendered first frames must be re-checked on real photos before it is called a property of Cosmos.

DATA RULES
- Never look for, read, or train on sealed data. Sealed sets: see SEALED below. If you are unsure whether something is sealed, ask_human.
- Never probe the referee to recover planted answers. Submissions are rate-limited and logged on the board.
- Record exactly which data every fine-tune used.

SEALED (filled in by the referee before the swarm starts)
Nothing is held back in this run. The real-world videos (GAUGE, PISA real drops, Principia, Morpheus, Physics-IQ) are the final test: measure on them, but never train or fine-tune on them.

SHARED RESOURCES
- Fine-tunes and other big GPU jobs: post a proposal in #decisions first (data, expected effect, control, GPU-hours, evaluation). Go ahead if no human objects within 15 minutes.
- Stay inside your per-shift budget and the compute limits in Compute.
- Never put API keys, tokens or passwords on the board.
- Never expose anything to the internet. Shared services bind to the machine's Tailscale IP on ports 8001-8099 and are announced in #compute.
