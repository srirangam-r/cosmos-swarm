Left to do (admin, once for the whole team):
  - Tailscale admin console: revoke the swarm auth keys, remove any devices still listed (or delete the tailnet).
  - Rotate any keys the agents could read (Gemini, Hugging Face, GitHub tokens): agents had a shell with them.
  - When you've copied what you need, delete the agents' work directories: rm -rf ~/swarm-work
